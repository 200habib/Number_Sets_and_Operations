## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is created to explore number sets and their relationships through practical exercises using PHP. The exercises will demonstrate key mathematical principles in an interactive way. 🖥️📊

## 📝 PHP Exercises

Each section will include PHP scripts that illustrate:
- 🧮 Number set definitions
- 🔗 Set operations
- 📏 Relationships between sets
- 📐 Mathematical properties of sets

The goal is to make mathematical set theory accessible to everyone by providing code-based examples that can be run and experimented with. 🚀💡

## 🤝 Contribution

I hope that everyone finds this project useful for understanding number sets and operations. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome! 🎉😊
