# Symmetric Difference (Δ) 🔄

The **symmetric difference** between two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that belong to **exactly one** of the two sets, but not both. 🎯

In mathematical terms:
\[ A \Delta B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) \]

Where:
- \( A \setminus B \) represents elements in \( A \) that are **not** in \( B \). 🚫
- \( B \setminus A \) represents elements in \( B \) that are **not** in \( A \). 🚫

---

## Example 🌟

Let’s say we have the following sets:
\[ A = \{1, 2, 4\} \]
\[ B = \{2, 3, 4, 5\} \]

The symmetric difference will be:
\[ A \Delta B = \{1, 3, 5\} \]

### Explanation:
- The element **1** is only in \( A \). ✔️
- The elements **3** and **5** are only in \( B \). ✔️
- The elements **2** and **4** are in **both** sets, so they are **excluded** from the symmetric difference. ❌
