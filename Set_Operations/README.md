# 📂 Set_Operations

This directory contains explanations and examples of various **set operations**. Each subdirectory represents a specific operation, and you'll find a `definition.txt` file in each one with a clear explanation and examples.

---

## 📁 Union (Unione)
- **File**: `definition.txt`
- **Description**:  
  The **union** of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that belong to \( A \) **or** \( B \).  
  🎯 **Example**:  
  \( A = \{1, 2\} \), \( B = \{2, 3\} \) → \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3\} \).

---

## 📁 Intersection (Intersezione)
- **File**: `definition.txt`
- **Description**:  
  The **intersection** of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that belong to **both** \( A \) **and** \( B \).  
  🎯 **Example**:  
  \( A = \{1, 2\} \), \( B = \{2, 3\} \) → \( A \cap B = \{2\} \).

---

## 📁 Difference (Differenza)
- **File**: `definition.txt`
- **Description**:  
  The **difference** between two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that belong to \( A \) **but not** to \( B \).  
  🎯 **Example**:  
  \( A = \{1, 2\} \), \( B = \{2, 3\} \) → \( A - B = \{1\} \).

---

## 📁 Symmetric_Difference (Differenza Simmetrica)
- **File**: `definition.txt`
- **Description**:  
  The **symmetric difference** of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all elements that belong to **either** \( A \) **or** \( B \) but **not both**.  
  � **Example**:  
  \( A = \{1, 2\} \), \( B = \{2, 3\} \) → \( A \Delta B = \{1, 3\} \).

---

## 📁 Complement (Complemento)
- **File**: `definition.txt`
- **Description**:  
  The **complement** of a set \( A \) with respect to a universal set \( U \) is the set of all elements in \( U \) that **do not belong** to \( A \).  
  🎲 **Example**:  
  \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \), \( A = \{1, 2\} \) → \( A' = \{3, 4\} \).

---

## 📁 Cartesian_Product (Prodotto Cartesiano)
- **File**: `definition.txt`
- **Description**:  
  The **Cartesian product** of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all **ordered pairs** \( (a, b) \) where \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \).  
  🧩 **Example**:  
  \( A = \{1, 2\} \), \( B = \{'a', 'b'\} \) →  
  \( A \times B = \{(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b')\} \).
